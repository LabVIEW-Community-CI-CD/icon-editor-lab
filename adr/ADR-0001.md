# ADR-0001: Adopt Multi-Agent Orchestration

Status: Proposed

## Context
Document the initial multi-agent automation approach for CI, docs hygiene, and release readiness.

## Decision
Adopt lightweight, non-destructive automation (Codex/Jarvis agents) that add CI workflows, ADR/RTM scaffolding, and supporting scripts without altering existing core assets.

## Consequences
- Coverage and docs gates surface quality regressions early.
- ADR/RTM scaffolding enables future compare runs to capture decision snippets.
- Additional agents must follow the same non-destructive, additive policy.
